Motivation
=============

The Civilsphere Project was born in 2018 the  Stratosphere Laboratory of the
Czech Technical University in Prague. In Civilsphere we believe that NGOs'
work, as well the work of journalists, activists, and human rights defenders is
a critical asset for our society and we need to protect them. It is their
critical work that makes them a highly valuable political target for a wide
variety of powerful actors. They receive a continuous flow of attacks and
technical abuse the jeopardizes the liberty and free expression in many
countries. At Civilsphere we took a step forward to help them by providing
free, advanced digital protection against state actors and others.

The AI VPN was designed to help people at risk obtain a quick and real time
security assessment of their devices' networkt traffic to identify if they are
compromised or at risk. The integration with the Stratosphere Linux IPS
provides state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to detect malware
infections.

This project was created in the Artificial Intelligence Centre of the Czech
Technical University in Prague in 2021. This project was initially funded by
the NL NET foundation.
