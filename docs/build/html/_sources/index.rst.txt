Welcome to AI VPN's documentation!
==================================

The AI VPN goal is to better protect the privacy of civil society by researching and developing a locally and easy to implement VPN that checks the traffic of devices with AI-based detection to automatically block threats and stop dangerous privacy leaks. The detection of malicious threats, attacks, infections and private leaked data is implemented using novel free software AI technology. The AI VPN was created by the Civilsphere Project at the Stratosphere Laboratory of the Czech Technical University in Prague.
