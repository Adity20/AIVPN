# AI VPN NO-OpenVPN Module

This module is part of the Civilsphere AI VPN. The module provides the OpenVPN
service for users to connect without encryption. This special module is to
provide support to users connecting from countries where encryption and/or
specifically the use of VPNs is illegal. The NO-OpenVPN features the same
functionality as the OpenVPN except that it does not encrypt the connections.
This allows to provide a security assessment of the network traffic while
keeping users from potential illegal activities.
